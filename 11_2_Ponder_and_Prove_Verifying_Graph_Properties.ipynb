Even though the assignment's focus is not on using this algorithm, I thought it was interesting to explore more about its purpose with graph theory. Graph problems depend upon efficiency to compute optimized answers and course of action. Similar to what I wrote for the previous week's connections, machine learning to recognize patterns depends upon defining the properties and their patterns are key to achieving the benefits of using machine learning. One interesting fact that I found is with the algorithm's ability to handle worst-case scenarios when an n-vertex graph has at most 3 n⁄3 maximal cliques."

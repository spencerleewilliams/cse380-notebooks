        "\n",
        "Rudy Rucker, in his book *Infinity and the Mind*, tells it like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "> In the summer of 1930, the 24-year-old Kurt G&ouml;del proved a strange theorem: *mathematics is open-ended*. There can never be a final, best system of mathematics. Every axiom-system for mathematics will eventually run into certain simple problems that it cannot solve at all. This is G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The implications of this epochal discovery are devastating. The thinkers of the Industrial Revolution liked to regard the universe as a vast preprogrammed machine. It was optimistically predicted that soon scientists would know all the rules, all the programs. But if G&ouml;del's Theorem tells us anything, it is this: Man will never know the final secret of the universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "> [...]\n",
        "\n",
        "> Machines will never have *all* the answers. There will always be room for a creative person who can think of a better way of doing things.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Try to catch the universe in a finite net of axioms and the universe will fight back. Reality is, on the deepest level, essentially infinite. No finitely programmed machine can ever exhaust the richness of the mental and physical world we inhabit.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The proof of G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem is so simple, and so sneaky, that it is almost embarassing to relate. His basic procedure is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "> 1. Someone introduces G&ouml;del to UTM, a machine that is supposed to be a Universal Truth Machine, capable of correctly answering any question at all.\n",
        "2. G&ouml;del asks for the program and circuit diagrams of the UTM. The program may be complicated, but it can only be finitely long. Call the program P(UTM) for Program of the Universal Truth Machine.\n",
        "3. Smiling a little, G&ouml;del writes out the following sentence: \"The machine constructed on the basis of the program P(UTM) will never say that this sentence is true.\"  Call this sentence G for G&ouml;del. Note that G is equivalent to \"UTM will never say G is true\".\n",
        "4. Now G&ouml;del laughs his high laugh and asks UTM whether G is true or not.\n",
        "5. If UTM says G is true, then \"UTM will never say G is true\" is false. If \"UTM will never say G is true\" is false, then G is false (since G = \"UTM will never say G is true.\") So if UTM says that G is true, then G is in fact false, and UTM has made a false statement. So UTM will never say that G is true, since UTM makes only true statements.\n",
        "6. We have established that UTM will never say G is true. So \"UTM will never say G is true\" is in fact a true sentence. So G is true (since G = \"UTM will never say G is true.\").\n",
        "7. \"I know a truth that UTM can never utter,\" G&ouml;del says. \"I know that G is true. UTM is not truly universal.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "> Think about it â€” it grows on you.\n"

[...] Define B to be the sentence \"B is not true.\" Is B true? The problem is that B is true if and only if B is not true. So B is somehow outside the scope of the applicability of the concepts \"true\" and \"not true.\" There is something viciously meaningless about the sentence B, and one is inclined just to try to forget about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "> But G&ouml;del's G sentence cannot be so lightly dismissed. With his great mathematical and logical genius, G&ouml;del was able to find a way (for any given P(UTM)) actually to write down a complicated polynomial equation that has a solution if and only if G is true. So G is not at all some vague or non-mathematical sentence. G *is a specific mathematical problem that we know the answer to, even though UTM does not!* So UTM does not, and cannot, embody a best and final theory of mathematics.\n",
        "\n",
        "> G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem flew in the face of the formalist and logical positivist movements of the time. But everyone who was capable of following the many steps of the detailed proof was forced to concede its correctness. G&ouml;del became famous."

On the other hand, on the basis of what has been proved so far, it remains possible that there may exist (and even be empirically discoverable) a theorem-proving machine which in fact is equivalent to mathematical intuition, but cannot be proved to be so, nor even be proved to yield only correct theorems of finitary number theory.\n",

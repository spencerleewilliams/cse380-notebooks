Number theory is exciting to learn, but it is certainly better to also benefit from the fruits of that learning in real life. While it is important to use RSA for security purposes, it was also to see how encryption can solve other types of problems like finding patterns or the longest message/substring. Even though it may not be the main or most effective use of encryption, it still is interesting to see how it can modify to do new things."

This research helped the most to understand why RSA encryption is considered the most effective/secure encryption method due to how it uses private keys."

However, I can see using the knowledge and tools gained from this experience to try new methods of encryption with different data types and perhaps with new styles of encryption like AES.

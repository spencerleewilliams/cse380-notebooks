        "The essay brings the perspective of probability to a new light. For some, and sometimes with myself too, to say that a probability is absolute is an odd conclusion to assert out loud. To say with certainty for small and or common occurrences are easier to say and believe, but to justify that within a city like New York at least this many people share such trait is often hard to visualize. The pigeonhole principle, however, shows that through the principles of graph theory and number theory the certainty is absolute. The essay describes this trait as the certainty-not feature, using the words at least two people will share a given trait. I discussed these thoughts with my Mom, and we both agreed that the principle's feature is a valuable tool with many applications like determining commonality, identity, and the difference between unique versus non-unique traits. Likewise, we had similar thoughts to the philosophical aspect of the pigeonhole principle too.  If the certainty of existence between two triats is helpful for businesses to consider investing, then knowing who exactly are those  people would guarntee a profit on their investments. Like the essay suggests, this knowledge would certainly be very helpful, however, I believe that the solution would vary depending on the specific traits you are looking for.\n",

However, after reading more about the principle and its applications, I find this is the point the author is trying to make. It does not matter what the traits and if they are related or not, the principle will work regardless in determining if there are at least two people that fit those traits or not.\n"

However, as the essay suggests, it seems that the harder question is not if they exist, but identify who the two are, no? I feel this can certainly be true when trying to date with the mindset of finding the one that matches."

I had known that certain traits and events over time were guarantees at 99.999%, but as a human, I often find myself skeptical of such conclusions, especially when they are only theoretical. Nevertheless, this assignment is helping to expand my mind on the capabilities that mathematics can contribute to computation and application in the real world. The pigeonhole's feature to provide absolute certainty in a set of traits is a valuable feature that many businesses are willing to pay. Most of the applications I read on the web mention theoretical or fun ideas, but I see the potential of connecting them to the possibilities of finding more connections to valuable information like the internet does with graph theory on social media."

One thing I saw and discussed with the essay is the similarity to the application problem between dating and graph theory and the pigeonhole principle and guaranteeing at least two matches. When given a large enough probability space, nodes, and connections between the nodes, the path to a connection with all matching traits is inevitable. Similiar to the concept of uncertainty, the pigeonhole principle acts as a counter postive in that there are also given certainties as there are to uncertainties.  "

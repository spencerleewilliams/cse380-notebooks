        "5. The factorization of 1105 is 5, 13, and 17. Since all factors are prime, the GCD of each of the factorizations of 1105 will always be one as it is the only common value amongst them.\r\n",
        "6. Considering that the only positive integer that divides between the factors of 1105 is one of pairwise coprime, it can then be proven via the Chinese Remainder Theorem that the pseudoprime will fool the FLT test for every base coprime to it. The theorem proves this notation as if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer n by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of n by the product of these integers (given that the divisors are pairwise coprime). Therefore, since every pair of the pseudoprime is pairwise coprime, then the remainder can consistently be determined by the division of nb the product of those integers."

The unique characteristics of primes, the relationship to infinity, and how they contribute to encoding and encryption, I thought, have been a lot to comprehend. However, to my surprise, I learn that another exponential relationship to a prime is divisible when N is prime. The unique thing about learning something new is then to see the change in reality as you notice its truth displayed in other aspects that you didn't notice before. For me, this was during the in-class activity and making the connection to consider exceptions like pseudoprimes that can trick Fermat's little theorem, which is a concept (varifying truths with primes) I never considered."

Two examples are when I took geometry in high school and more, recently, in college with linear algebra. At first, I found proofs in geometry as burdens and too formal for their purpose. However, later on in college, I notice the importance of clarifying doubts via symbols and proofs where language struggles to communicate even within the same language for native speakers."

        "1. Triple DES: Triple Data Encryption Algorithm or Triple-DES uses symmetric encryption. It is an advanced version of DES block cipher, which used to have a 56-bit key. However, and as the name suggests, TDES encrypts data using 56-bit key thrice, making it a 168-bit key. \r\n",
        "2. AES: The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is also symmetric encryption based on the Rijndael algorithm.  It uses block-cipher and encrypts one fixed-size block at a time. It works in 128-bit or 192-bit but can be extended up to the 256-bit key length. To encrypt every bit, there are different rounds. For instance, 128-bit will have 10 rounds, 192-bit will have 12 rounds and so on\r\n",
        "It is considered as one of the best encryption algorithms because it was developed by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is also one of the secured types of encryptions as it works on a single private key.\r\n",
        "3. Blowfish: Another encryption algorithm designed to replace DES, Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher, which works on a variable key length from 32 bits to 448 bits. Since it is a block cipher, therefore it divides data or a message into fixed 64-bit blocks when encrypting and decrypting. \r\n",
        "4. Twofish: Also a symmetric block cipher, Twofish is an advanced version of Blowfish encryption. It has a block size of 128-bits and can extend to the 256-bit key length. Like other symmetric ciphers, it also breaks data into fixed-length blocks. However, it functions in 16 rounds regardless of how large the data is. Amongst the various types of encryption, this one is flexible. It allows you to choose the encryption process to be quick while the key setup to be slow and vice versa.\r\n",
        "5. FPE: Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) is a fairly new encryption method. It encrypts your data in a similar format. For instance, if you have encrypted your password having 6 letters, 5 numbers and 4 special letters, then your output will be a different combination of a similar format.\r\n",
        "In other words, if you use this encryption technique, it will preserve the format of your plain text that is after encryption the structure of your data will remain the same.\r\n",
